            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Hi, I'm Katie Siegel.</strong> My journey as a front-end
              web developer is just starting, but with a passion for learning
              and immersive design, I'm ready to learn, grow, and innovate.
            </p>

            <p>
              My background is far from ordinary having worked in film,
              television, and theatre for over a decade. During this time, I
              have honed excellent communication skills and made
              cross-functional working environments second nature. This
              instilled in me the importance of creating solutions that are both
              engaging and accessible. One of the hallmarks of my career is
              constantly working to increase opportunities for conversation and
              understanding between diverse groups and wider inclusion. I also
              have a passion for analytical, interpretive, and critical
              thinking. All this combined with my lifelong dedication to
              continuing education have led me to this new chapter. If you're
              ready to join me <strong>let's go!</strong>
